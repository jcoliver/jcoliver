I am the Data Science Specialist in the University of Arizona Libraries. In 
addition to teaching and consulting for programming in R, I lead the 
[Data Cooperative](https://data.library.arizona.edu), which supports 
data-intensive research at the University of Arizona.

This page is a work in progress. Yay. Progress.
